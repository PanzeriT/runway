# Runway

Runway is a simple, lightweight, auto-generated backend framework written in Go.
It enables rapid development by automatically generating and Admin Console
using [Gorm](https://gorm.io/)
Designed for flexibility and ease of use, Runway allows developers to quickly
scaffold robust backends with minimal configuration, while still supporting
custom logic and extensions. Its efficient, modular architecture makes it ideal
for building modern web applications, prototypes, and internal tools with
minimal overhead.

# Initialize the project
go mod init myrunwayapp

# Get Runway
go get github.com/panzerit/runway

cat >main.go <<EOF
package main

import (
        "log"

        "github.com/panzerit/runway"
        "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
        "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
        db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("db.sqlite3"), &gorm.Config{})
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("failed connecting to sqlite3: %v", err)
        }

        app := runway.New("Runway Tester", "1234567890123456", db)

        // this would override the default homepage
        // app.Server.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
        //      return c.String(200, "Hello from Runway!")
        // })

        app.Start()
}
EOF

# Clean up
go mod tidy

# Run the app
