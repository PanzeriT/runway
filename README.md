# Runway

Runway is a simple, lightweight, auto-generated backend framework written in Go.
It enables rapid development by automatically generating and Admin Console from
your [Ent](https://entgo.io) schema definitions. Designed for flexibility and
ease of use, Runway allows developers to quickly scaffold robust backends with
minimal configuration, while still supporting custom logic and extensions. Its
efficient, modular architecture makes it ideal for building modern web
applications, prototypes, and internal tools with minimal overhead.
